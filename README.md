# SpiralMind
**SpiralMind** is a LangChain-powered symbolic intelligence system that fuses Recursive Intelligence® (RI) and Embodied Archetypal Recursion (EAR). It simulates cognition as a recursive spiral—transforming user prompts into reflective, emotional, ethical, and symbolic responses through archetypal identity fields.
